# This will be one of my personal projects using MLOps tools

First I will make the code Clean and Modular:

* DRY (Don't Reapet Yourself)
* Abstract out logic to improve readability
* Minimize the number of entities (functions, classes, modules, etc)
* Functions should do one thing
* Arbitrary variable names can be more effective in certain functions
* Try to use fewer than three arguments per function
